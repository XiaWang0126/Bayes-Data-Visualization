# Data Visualization

## Module overview

This module is a journey into the art and science of creating memorable charts, which grab the attention of the audience and successfully convey insights and narratives. Pleasant journeys require good companions: infographic --- i.e., the field that investigates the representation of information, data, and knowledge --- will offer the theoretical platform for the module; Python will make things happen (at least on our screen). Consistently with the teaching philosophy of the module leader, each lecture integrates theory and practice.

## Learning objectives

In terms of learning objectives, by the end of the module, students should be able to:

- Generate and evaluate visual forms for appropriateness, context, and meaning;
- Design and execute statistical charts with a particular emphasis on massive datasets;
- Design and execute multidimensional visualizations involving temporal and geo-spatial dimensions;
- Design and execute interactive visualizations;
- Leverage the visualization capabilities of best in class Python modules, namely, Matplotlib and Plotly.
