# Project Description

Students — working in groups — are supposed:

1. to familiarize with the TikTok Trending Videos dataset
2. to use Python to analyze the above-mentioned dataset and produce three statistical charts that complement an article for the printed version of the New York Times on 'what makes TikTok' videos (super-)popular
3. to produce a companion document that — in plain English — describes and arguments the design choices behind the three statistical charts
